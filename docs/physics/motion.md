# Motion

Inertia: how much effort(force) required to change the state(mass, velocity) of a thing.

time: distance <-> velocity <-> accelaration

Newton's law:
1. inertia
2. how force interact with inertia (a intermediate state - momentum)
3. some other thing about force

# Transition

# Rotation

Center of Mass

$$
\bold{R} = \sum_i m_i \bold{r}_i/M
$$

principal axis of body

External force

$$
\bold{F} = M(d^2\bold{R}/dt^2)
$$

Moment of inertia:

$$
I_z = \sum_i m_i(x^2_i+ y^2_i) = \int (x^2 + y^2)dm
$$

Torque

$$
\tau = \bold{r} \times \bold{F}
$$

Angular momentum

$$
\bold{L} = \bold{r} \times \bold{p}
$$

$$
\bold{F} = d\bold{p}/dt
$$

$$
\bold{\tau} = d\bold{L}/dt
$$

Power

$$
P = \tau \cdot \omega
$$

$$
\bold{v} = \bold{\omega} \times \bold{r}
$$

Centrifugal force (result of inertia)

Coriolis force (result of curvature, the compensation of the difference between angular velocity and linear velocity)

$$
\bold{F}_c = 2m \bold{v} \times \bold{\  omega}
$$

For circle rotation
$$
\tau = F_cr = \frac{dL}{dt} = \frac{d(m\omega r^2)}{dt} = 2m\omega r \frac{dr}{dt} 
$$

$$
F_c = \tau / r = 2m \omega v_r
$$

Precession: If we apply a torque to a repidly spinning top, the direction of precsssional motion is in the direction of the torque, or the right angles to the forces producing the torque.

$$
\tau = \Omega \times \bold{L}_0
$$

Nutation (cycloid)

\Omega is the presession angular velocity, L_0 is the spinning angular velocity, and \tau is the torque we apply to the system.

## Theorem

Theorem of Pappus: If we take any closed area in a plane and generate a solid by moving it through space such that each point is always moved perpendicular to the plane of the area, the resulting solid has a total volume equal to the area of the cross section times the distance that the center of mass moved.

Parallel-axis theorem:

$$
I =I_c + MR^2_\text{CM}
$$

Plane figure:

$$
I_z = I_x + I_y
$$
