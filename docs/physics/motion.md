# Motion

Inertia: how much effort(force) required to change the state(mass, velocity) of a thing.

time: distance <-> velocity <-> accelaration

Newton's law:
1. inertia
2. how force interact with inertia (a intermediate state - momentum)
3. some other thing about force

# Transition

# Rotation

Center of Mass

$$
\bold{R} = \sum_i m_i \bold{r}_i/M
$$

External force

$$
\bold{F} = M(d^2\bold{R}/dt^2)
