# Probability

"Probability" of a particular outcome of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yield that particular outcome.

1. A probability of something happening only if the occurrence is a possible outcome of some repeatable observation.
2. $N_A$ is our best estimate of what would occur in $N$ imagined observations.

$$
P(A) = N_A/N
$$

Fluctuation

杨辉三角 / Pascal's Triangle -- binominal coefficient:

$$
(^n_k)= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

$$
n!=(n)(n-1)(n-2)...(3)(2)(1)
$$

$$
P(k,n) = \frac{(^n_k)}{2^n}
$$

Bernoulli / binomial probability:

$$
P(k,n) = (^n_k)p^kq^{n-k}
$$
