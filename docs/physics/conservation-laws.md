# Conservation laws

A process is following a law.

Consevation is a constant in nature; it is always constant.

## Energy (independent of absolute time)

$$
E
$$

Elastic: no kinetic energy loss

## Momentum (independent of space)

$$
p
$$

internal force, external force

Momentum can exsist as a property of a field (equivalence of force in relativity theory)

### Patterns of momentum conservation

Elastic collision, non-elastic collition

### Relativity (mechanics)

law of physics independent of speed of system

Newton: The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.

Galilean's transformation:

$$
x' = x - ut
$$

$$
y' = y
$$

$$
z' = z
$$

$$
t' = t
$$

Lorentz's transformation:

$$
x' = \frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
$$

$$
y' = y
$$

$$
z' = z
$$

$$
t' = \frac{t-ux/c^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
$$

Einstein's special theory of relativity:

$$
m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
$$

### Linear momentum

### Angular momentum (independet of angular orientation)

## Charge

## Baryons

## Leptons
