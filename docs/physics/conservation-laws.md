# Conservation laws

A process is following a law.

Consevation is a constant in nature; it is always constant.

## Energy (independent of absolute time)

$$
E
$$

Elastic: no kinetic energy loss

## Momentum (independent of space)

$$
p
$$

internal force, external force

Momentum can exsist as a property of a field (equivalence of force in relativity theory)

### Patterns of momentum conservation

[momentum conservation] Elastic collision: only kinetic energy is considered (no other kinds of energy is involved in the conservation system).

[energy conservation] non-elastic collition: kinetic energy could be transformed to other kinds of energy (i.e. potential energy) in the conservation system.

### Relativity (mechanics)

Light: 
1. Speed of light is constant in all systems.
2. Nothing moves faster than speed of light.

law of physics independent of speed of system

Newton: The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.

Galilean's linear transformation:

$$
x' = x - ut
$$

$$
y' = y
$$

$$
z' = z
$$

$$
t' = t
$$

Galilean's rotation transformation:

$$
x' = x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta
$$

$$
y' = y \cos \theta - x \sin \theta
$$

$$
z' = z
$$

$$
x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 
$$

Lorentz's transformation:

result of contraction
$$
x' = \frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
$$

$$
y' = y
$$

$$
z' = z
$$

result of simultaneity
$$
t' = \frac{t-ux/c^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
$$

Four-vector momentum (E=m)

$$
p'_x = \frac{p_x-uE}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}
$$

$$
p'_y = p_y
$$

$$
p'_z = p_z
$$

$$
E' = \frac{E-up_x}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}
$$

"rotation" analogy
$$
x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 - ct'^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - ct^2
$$

Contraction:

$$
L = L_0\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}
$$

Einstein's special theory of relativity:

$$
m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}
$$

Two observers, A stationary, B moving at speed u in x direction, object a in B system moving at speed v' (observed by B):

If v' only in x direction, speed of a in x direction observed by A is:

$$
v_x = \frac{u+v'}{1+u'v'/c^2}
$$

If v' only in y direction, speed of a observed by A is:

$$
v_y = v'\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}
$$


#### Space-time

Distance

$$
d = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}
$$

Interval
$$
I = \sqrt{ct^2-x^2-y^2-z^2}
$$

Space-like interval if I is imaginary

Time-like interval if I is real

### Linear momentum

### Angular momentum (independet of angular orientation)

## Charge

## Baryons

## Leptons
