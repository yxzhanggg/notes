# Conservation laws

A process is following a law.

Consevation is a constant in nature; it is always constant.

## Energy (independent of absolute time)

$$
E
$$

Elastic: no kinetic energy loss

## Momentum (independent of space)

$$
p
$$

internal force, external force

Momentum can exsist as a property of a field (equivalence of force in relativity theory)

### Patterns of momentum conservation

Elastic collision, non-elastic collition

### Galilean relativity

law of physics independent of speed of system

### Linear momentum

### Angular momentum (independet of angular orientation)

## Charge

## Baryons

## Leptons
