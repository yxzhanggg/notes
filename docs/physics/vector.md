# Vector

Invariance/Symmetry: A thing is symmetrical if one can subject it to a certain operation and it appears exactlu the same after the operation. (Professor Hermann Weyl)

# Transition

# Rotation

Linearity ensures each part to maintain its 
1. "self-contain"ness of physical laws and 
2. indistinguishability 
after any operation.

polar vector: Ordinary, "honest"

axial vector / pseudovector: Vectors which involve just one cross product in their definition.
