Reversibility: you can move between different states without lossing energy; which means, you can always return back to any state without any effort.


# Potential energy (relative location)

Assumption: not too far from the earth
$$
\text{Change in energy} = \text{force} \times \text{distance force acts through}
$$


## Gravitational potential energy
Assumption: not too far from the earth

$$
\text{Gravitational potential energy for one object} = \text{weight} \times \text{hight}
$$

# Electrical potential energy
