# Forms of Energy

Reversibility: you can move between different states without lossing energy; which means, you can always return back to any state without any effort.


## Potential energy (relative location)

Assumption: not too far from the earth
$$
\text{Change in energy} = \text{force} \times \text{distance force acts through}
$$

Principle of virtual work: Solve problem in static state by assuming it moves a little.

### Gravitational potential energy
Assumption: not too far from the earth

$$
\text{Gravitational potential energy for one object} = \text{weight} \times \text{hight}
$$

### Electrical potential energy

## Kinetic energy (motion)

$$
K.E. = WV^2/2g
$$

### Heat energy (internal motion)

### Mass energy (sheer exsitance, relativity theory)

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Electrical energy (charges)

### radiant energy (light)

## Chemical energy (reactions, attraction of atoms)
1. kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms
2. electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons

### Elastic energy (spring tension)

## Nuclear energy (arrangement of particles inside the nucleus)
