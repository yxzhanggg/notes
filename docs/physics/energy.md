# Forms of Energy

Reversibility: you can move between different states without lossing energy; which means, you can always return back to any state without any effort.


## Potential energy (relative location)

Assumption: not too far from the earth
$$
\text{Change in energy} = \text{force} \times \text{distance force acts through}
$$

Principle of virtual work: Solve problem in static state by assuming it moves a little.


Potential and field are instanciated as potential energy and force, by multiplying the quantity, respectively. Essentially, potential and field are two ways that describing one thing, by scalar and vector, respectively; they are statistical skeleton.


### Gravitational potential energy
Assumption: not too far from the earth

$$
\text{Gravitational potential energy for one object} = \text{weight} \times \text{hight}
$$

potential energy and potential

$$
U = m\Psi
$$

Field and potential

$$
\bold{C} = -\nabla\Psi
$$

Force and field

$$
\bold{F} = m\bold{C}
$$

Force and potential energy

$$
\bold{F} = -\nabla U
$$

### Electrical potential energy

potential energy and potential

$$
U = q\phi
$$

Field and potential

$$
\bold{E} = -\nabla\phi
$$


Electrical force and electrical field

$$
\bold{F} = q \bold{E}
$$

Force and potential energy

$$
\bold{F} = -\nabla U
$$

## Kinetic energy (motion)

$$
K.E. = WV^2/2g
$$

$$
T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

Power [j/s][w]
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = \bold{F}\cdot\bold{v} 
$$

Theorem: The rate of change of kinetic energy of an object is equal to the power expended by the forces acting on it.

Work (done by the foece on the object) [NÂ·m][j]

$$
\Delta T = \int^2_1 \bold{F}\cdot d\bold{s}
$$


### Heat energy (internal motion)

### Mass energy (sheer exsitance, relativity theory)

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Electrical energy (charges)

### radiant energy (light)

## Chemical energy (reactions, attraction of atoms)
1. kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms
2. electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons

### Elastic energy (spring tension)

## Nuclear energy (arrangement of particles inside the nucleus)
