# Forms of Energy

Reversibility: you can move between different states without lossing energy; which means, you can always return back to any state without any effort.


## Potential energy (relative location)

Assumption: not too far from the earth
$$
\text{Change in energy} = \text{force} \times \text{distance force acts through}
$$

Principle of virtual work: Solve problem in static state by assuming it moves a little.

### Gravitational potential energy
Assumption: not too far from the earth

$$
\text{Gravitational potential energy for one object} = \text{weight} \times \text{hight}
$$

### Electrical potential energy

## Kinetic energy (motion)

$$
K.E. = WV^2/2g
$$

$$
T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

Power [j/s][w]
$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = \bold{F}\cdot\bold{v} 
$$

Theorem: The rate of change of kinetic energy of an object is equal to the power expended by the forces acting on it.

Work (done by the foece on the object) [NÂ·m][j]

$$
\Delta T = \int^2_1 \bold{F}\cdot d\bold{s}
$$


### Heat energy (internal motion)

### Mass energy (sheer exsitance, relativity theory)

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Electrical energy (charges)

### radiant energy (light)

## Chemical energy (reactions, attraction of atoms)
1. kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms
2. electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons

### Elastic energy (spring tension)

## Nuclear energy (arrangement of particles inside the nucleus)
