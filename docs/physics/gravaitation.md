# Gravitation

$$
F = G\frac{mm'}{r^2}
$$

## Kepler's laws

1. Each planets moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun at one focus.
2. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
3. The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axies of their respective orbits.

$$
T ~ a^{3/2}
$$

Cavendish's experiment
$$
G = 6.670\times10^{-11} \text{newton} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2
$$

## Pseudo force

Pseudo force is the result of mass(inertia); it states that the force is the result of complicated geometry of the world, instead of the the force itself(definition).
